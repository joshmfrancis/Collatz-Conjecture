This is a simple Python program that implements the Collatz Conjecture. The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The conjecture states that, given any positive integer, if you repeatedly apply the following algorithm:

If the number is even, divide it by 2
If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
you will eventually reach the number 1.

This program allows you to enter in an integer, and then displays the sequence of numbers generated by the Collatz Conjecture. For example, if you enter the number 10, the program will calculate the following sequence:

10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

This program serves as a graphical representation of the Collatz Conjecture and can be used as a tool to explore the behavior of this fascinating mathematical problem.

Here is a test run of the program:
